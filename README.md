Scripting and programming for sidescroller shmup

Hi!

From a few years I wan't to develop a shmup game such as Aero Fighters or Darius. I started on C and programming a custom engine as 
I felt confortable with the language but early on I switched to what I thought would be easier options. I found Unity could fill the 
gaps of my lack of knowledge but soon after I found myself struggling with my incompetence. So this is it. I just wan't to learn and 
maybe I could help someone.
